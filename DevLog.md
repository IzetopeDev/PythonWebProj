# About
Here will be where I write my thoughts and plans each time I open this document. 
The latest entry will be at the top and everything else will be pushed to the bottom (only applies to new day entry).
I will be following a format as follows:

### Note to self
All DevLog changes done on **"main" branch.**
When experimenting with new stuff **_create a new branch_**!

I decided to add some stuff to the html and css because, where I am now, I cannot do much. Thus, I just decided that I should at the very least figure out something for the website. There are some ideas I have, which I've written as comments in the html. but to summarise the more important stuff here: I am now planning to do even bigger things. For example, I need to program a small website game (maybe even make it 2 player) and then have an adventure style game (which I have 0 idea what it should be based on. Not to forget, I haven't even started actually learning to do the backend of the site yet. Plus, I still need to refigure out some stuff about javascript. So yeah... I might be biting off more than I can chew here. I suppose the best option now is just to take things one step at a time.

Plans: 
- Start learning django (or at least installing it)

I don't have a lot of time today so that's about it
### 1000
I started the django tutorial but am now figuring out how virtual environment works lol
### 1030
making a venv. Just realised I'm in the main branch oops
### 1100
Just merged everything into the stuff. 
Turns out installing files into the active branch is a very unwise thing to do. Especially after making commits lol... 
Next time whenever I am not sure what in the world I'm doing I'll do them in another branch. Though I'm not sure how that would work exactly.

Finally starting with the website. At least I'm writing something in this doc. There are many things I have to do. For now the plan is to
Get everything set up properly in github
- such as the main and other branches
figure out the general flow of how to make a website that uses python...
- as of now I figured out that I'll probably be **using django** *(which I have 0 idea how it works)*
- I will need to make a **html and css backbone** *(not sure how JS will fit into everything)*

### around 10pm?
What I've done:
I've set linked VSC to github
started this doc
learned about django's existence

### 2300
So, I've set up the barebones of the website. Everything's gonna be placed into the unlaunched branch for now.
I've also redownloaded python onto the computer. Trying to download django now... but for some reason even though I downloaded python from the python.org site, it's not recognised on the computer. I think I need to restart my computer. 
Thus, I'll be restarting the computer and stopping for the day. I may or may not continue tomorrow. Still need to prep to get back to camp.
Also there are going to be pull req problems when it comes to DevLogs LOL.
I also forgot to mention that I've learned about classes in python. Pretty cool stuff.
