# About
Here will be where I write my thoughts and plans each time I open this document. 
The latest entry will be at the top and everything else will be pushed to the bottom (only applies to new day entry).
I will be following a format as follows:
##Date
Plan:
###time
Entry

### Note to self
All DevLog changes done on **"main" branch.**

## 240324
Plans: 
- Start learning django (or at least installing it)

I don't have a lot of time today so that's about it
### 1000
I started the django tutorial but am now figuring out how virtual environment works lol
### 1030
making a venv. Just realised I'm in the main branch oops


## 230324
Finally starting with the website. At least I'm writing something in this doc. There are many things I have to do. For now the plan is to
Get everything set up properly in github
- such as the main and other branches
figure out the general flow of how to make a website that uses python...
- as of now I figured out that I'll probably be **using django** *(which I have 0 idea how it works)*
- I will need to make a **html and css backbone** *(not sure how JS will fit into everything)*

### around 10pm?
What I've done:
I've set linked VSC to github
started this doc
learned about django's existence

### 2300
So, I've set up the barebones of the website. Everything's gonna be placed into the unlaunched branch for now.
I've also redownloaded python onto the computer. Trying to download django now... but for some reason even though I downloaded python from the python.org site, it's not recognised on the computer. I think I need to restart my computer. 
Thus, I'll be restarting the computer and stopping for the day. I may or may not continue tomorrow. Still need to prep to get back to camp.
Also there are going to be pull req problems when it comes to DevLogs LOL.
I also forgot to mention that I've learned about classes in python. Pretty cool stuff.
