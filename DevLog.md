The latest entry will be at the top and everything else will be pushed to the bottom.

*nothing to note for now I suppose*

Finally starting with the website. At least I'm writing something in this doc. There are many things I have to do. For now the plan is to
Get everything set up properly in github
- such as the main and other branches
figure out the general flow of how to make a website that uses python...
- as of now I figured out that I'll probably be **using django** *(which I have 0 idea how it works)*
- I will need to make a **html and css backbone** *(not sure how JS will fit into everything)*

What I've done:
I've set linked VSC to github
started this doc
learned about django's existence
